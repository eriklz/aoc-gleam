# Advent of Code solutions in Gleam

This is my repository for doing Advent of Code in Gleam.
It is done as an exercise to get more familiar with the language.

Run `gleam test`to run all the unit tests
Run `gleam run`to run all the assignments done, with actual data in the data directory.

The actual data is not checked in, since this is individual and you are not supposed to expose your own data.

The expected filename format is 

`data/YYYY/dayNN_part1.txt` and `data/YYYY/dayNN_part2.txt`, where YYYY is the year and NN is the day number.

If the input is the same for both parts, then only part1 is used.
